# Data-Alg-Project

Final Project for CPSC 3620 (Data Structures and Algorithms). This project implements and stress-tests the Edit Distance algorithm using both naïve and optimized dynamic programming approaches, as described in the textbook *Algorithms* by Jeff Erickson ([link](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/)).

## Features
- Naïve dynamic programming implementation of the Edit Distance algorithm.
- Optimized dynamic programming implementation of the Edit Distance algorithm.
- Stress testing and performance comparison.

## Requirements
- **Compiler**: g++ (GCC)
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows with a compatible terminal.

## Compilation
To compile the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
g++ FinalPrj.cpp -o a
```

## Execution
After compiling, you can run the program using:
```bash
./a
```

## Project Structure
- FinalPrj.cpp: Main source code file containg inplementation.
- README.md: Project documentation (this file).
- LICENSE: Usage purposes.
- .gitignore: Ignore the built .exes from being pushed to cloud repo.
